### Listening to flow events

You can listen to flow events by passing `onFlowStart` and `onFlowFinish` options to `execute` function.

```ts
const onFlowStart = (flow, context) => {
  console.log('Flow started', flow.agent.name)
}

const onFlowFinish = (flow, result) => {
  console.log('Flow finished', flow.agent.name, result)
}

execute(flow, {
  onFlowStart,
  onFlowFinish
})
```

:::tip[Assign unique name to each flow for better debugging]
If you have multiple agents with the same name in your flow, you can give each flow a unique name.
```ts ins={2,11}
const flow = {
  name: 'getGithubProjects',
  agent: 'myAgent',
  input: 'myInput'
}

execute(flow, {
  onFlowStart: (flow) => {
		// flow.name is now available and will unique
    // you can still console log flow.agent.name tho
    console.log('Flow started', flow.name)
  },
})
```

### Changing default model

You can configure the model for all built-in agents by passing `model` option to `execute` function. By default, all built-in agents use `gpt-4o` model.

```ts ins={7}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'

const result = await execute(flow, {
  agents: {
    sequenceAgent: myCustomAgent,
  },
  model: openai('gpt-4o')
})
```

### Overriding built-in agents

If, for some reason, you want to override the built-in agents, you can do so by simply including them in the `agents` object.

```ts ins={3}
const result = await execute(flow, {
  agents: {
    sequenceAgent: myCustomAgent,
  },
})
```
